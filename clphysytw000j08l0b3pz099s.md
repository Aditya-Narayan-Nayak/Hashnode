Its very simple. let's start with how to get this error I'm assuming you already have installed go lang in your machine.

### ðŸš€Step 1:-

Now just go to desktop and create a folder called go lang and open that in VS Code.

### ðŸš€Step 2:-

Create a folder called cards inside there create main.go and paste the following code given below

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
)
func main() {
	// var card string = "Ace of Spades"
	cards := []string{"Ace of Diamonds", newcard()}
	cards = append(cards, "Six of shades")

	for i, card := range cards {
		fmt.Println(i, card)
	}
}
func newcard() string {
	return "Five of Demonds"
}
```

### ðŸš€Step 3:-

in Golang folder create a file called cs.go and paste the code below

```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
)
func main() {
	cards := "Ace of shades" 	
	fmt.Println(cards)
}
```

The Folder would look like this

### ðŸš€Step 5: -

Let's fix this. Now go back to the terminal and see your path. and type

```powershell
cd cs
```
